# VuelingHackaton_challenge
This repository contains the challenge to the vueling and BarcelonaActiva hackaton on february 23<br />
My name is Pau Calabr√©s and i'm studiing Java at the ItAcademy of Barcelona Activa <br />
The objective of the challege was to make an MVP for a new travel finder feature of an online travel agency (OTA)<br />

#### These are the functional requirements:<br />
- &nbsp;The application takes at least three letters from standard input to execute the search.<br />

- &nbsp;The app should search for trips with cities that match the text entered by the user anywhere in the city name.<br />

- &nbsp;We have two types of travel: "land travel" and "air travel". Each with some specific characteristics.<br />
&nbsp;- &nbsp;A "land trip" has two hotels with their names and categories.<br />
&nbsp;- &nbsp;An "air trip" has two flights with their departure city and departure time.<br />

- &nbsp;We are growing overseas, so your solution should support Middle East and Asian languages.<br />

- &nbsp;The application should return the result using the standard output view:<br />
&nbsp;- &nbsp;Trip Name.<br />
&nbsp;- &nbsp;Type of trip.<br />
&nbsp;- &nbsp;Duration.<br />
&nbsp;- &nbsp;Names of the cities.<br />
&nbsp;- &nbsp;Specific details (For hotels: name and category, for flights: departure city and time).<br />

#### These are the thechnical requirements:
- &nbsp;Your system is growing, and restrictions may change. Also, further restrictions can be added. Prepare your system to be manageable to add new features.

- &nbsp;Please don't use frameworks like Symphony, Laravel, etc. You can use any particular library or editor if you need to.
